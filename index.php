				<p class="content">Information technology – often shortened to just IT – is a buzz phrase you’ve probably heard ad
					nauseum if you happen to work with IT personnel or went to school for anything related to computers. IT workers
					are highly specialized in their field, which is probably why they’re often just called “IT nerds.” They like what
					they do and understand it inside and out. IT workers are also essential to just about every modern business model.
					If a company relies on phones and emails, chances are that there’s an IT professional behind it all making sure
					the cogs in the machine function properly.</p>
